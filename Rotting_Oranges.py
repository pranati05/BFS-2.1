# Time Complexity : O(N)
# Space Complexity : O(N)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Using BFS. Initialize a queue and iterate over the grid to find the rotten oranges and append the index i and j to queue
# If there is a fresh orange increment fresh by one
# If after iterating over the grid there is no fresh orange at all then return there itself
# Until queue is empty iterate over the queue and pop the indexes i and j
# Initialize a list of tuples with the 4 directions or neighbors
# Iterate over the neighbors and get the row and col index by adding i and j with each neighbor
# Check the boundaries of row and col and check if the orange is fresh then append it to queue and make current one rotten and decrement the fresh by one
# Increment the time by one until for each level until the queue is not empty
# Then check after incrementing the time if there is any fresh orange left if not return time
# In the end return -1
